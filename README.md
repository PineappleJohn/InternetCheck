# Internet Check
Made for my game, "Silly Monkies" Sends a webrequest on start to check the users internet.
# Disclaimer:
This isn't something huge, I just made it to test the functionality of some stuff for my custom map maker. (MMB) <br/>
Well, if you still want to use this, go right ahead! Credit me if you'd like, I could not care less. <br/>
Just don't pass this on as your own, I made this not you.
# How does it work?
Well, to start I feel that tutorials don't provide enough info on how the script works, and just throw the script at you. <br/>
So I'll write this to give a brief summary of it's functionality. <br/>
<br/>
Well, on Start(), it sends a WebRequest, if it returns a connection error, then no wifi! Else, you infact have wifi. <br/>
If you have no wifi, then we run a unity event.
